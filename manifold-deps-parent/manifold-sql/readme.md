Manifold provides a simple alternative to conventional JDBC abstractions that makes it possible to use native SQL
directly and type-safely from Java code.

- Entity types are automatically derived from JDBC metadata at compile-time, fully relational/FK aware, CRUD, etc.
- Query types are instantly available as you type native SQL of any complexity in your IDE
- Query results are type-safe and type-rich and simple to use (see examples below)
- No ORM, No DSLs, No annotations, and No code generation build steps

Use Manifold simply by adding the Manifold compiler [plugin](https://github.com/manifold-systems/manifold) and dependencies
to your gradle or maven build.
